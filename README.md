## Summary
Generates a custom report for packing products by displaying a comma separated array and/or an object table in console when executed on browser.

## How it works
Gets data by looking for html classes and attributes. Consolidated the data to make a comma separated array. Used a class and constructor to convert values of array into objects, assigning it with properties and values. 

## Room for improvement
* Display the output in a more user-friendly front end interface using iframe to reference a read-only source.
* Make the report more print-friendly
